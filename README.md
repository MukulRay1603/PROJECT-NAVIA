# Washington D.C. Routing: Dijkstra vs A* Algorithms

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MukulRay1603/PROJECT-NAVIA/blob/main/PROJ_NAVIA_Washington_D_C_Routing_Dijkstra_vs_A_.ipynb)

This project compares the performance and pathfinding results of Dijkstra's algorithm and the A* (A-star) algorithm for road routing in Washington, D.C.

We use OpenStreetMap data and visualize the computed routes with interactive folium maps.  
All code is provided in a Google Colab-friendly Jupyter notebook.

**Note:**  
Folium map previews are static on GitHub. For full interactive maps and experimentation, open the notebook in [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MukulRay1603/PROJECT-NAVIA/blob/main/PROJ_NAVIA_Washington_D_C_Routing_Dijkstra_vs_A_.ipynb).

## Features

- Load and visualize the Washington, D.C. road network
- Implement Dijkstra’s and A* algorithms
- Compare routes, runtimes, and costs
- Visualize both algorithms' paths on a folium map

## Quick Start

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. Run all cells to interact with the routing maps.
